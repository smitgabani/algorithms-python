# Algorithms implemented in python3 

Read explain.md file in each directory for explanation and visual representation.

I highly recommend that you first implement the algorithms in C/C++ of Java. This is because C and C++ are both fast language and if you want to learn algorithms for competitive programming it is very important to select a fast language as time is monitored while solving problems. C++ is the ideal language as it is a mid level language which supports multiple paradigms mainly Object Oriented Programming. Almost all Data structures can be implemented using C++. 

Later when you reach a point where you feel confident, write the same algorithms in python so as to clear the algorithm concepts and help improve your python skills.
If you dont understand the Object Oriented Part in the algorithms focus on the functions. I am a beginner in python and algorithms so all code is simple yet.
